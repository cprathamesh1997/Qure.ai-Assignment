## Qure.ai-Assignment
## *The assignment requires writing an automated script using Python to send periodic data summaries to Slack or an email address. The objective is to post monthly trend analysis of the number of COVID deaths from the top 3 states.* 


## Assignment Problem Statement:-

## *Write an automated script using Python that sends a periodic data summary to Slack (preferred) or to an Email address. You can get a free slack account and establish web-hooks to post the summary. For this exercise, you can post the monthly trend analysis of the number of covid deaths from top 3 states. You can be creative and figure out some different mechanism (other than slack/email) as well - the goal is to send updates to a group of users about important metrics periodically. You will be asked to explain your solution during the next round. Please send your submission in the form of GitHub or a pdf report with screenshots (please donâ€™t send non-pdf files).*
## *There should be 4 messages posted (by a script/ bot you build using python) at a fixed interval for the month of March, April, May, and June.*
